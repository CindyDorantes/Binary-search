## Challenge description

### Binary Search

The method sqrt takes in one square number. 

Fill the method sqrt_recursive that returns the square root of a given number.
Do not use any built in methods for calculating the square-root and don't try searching through all the numbers. Instead, use a binary-style search to home in on the actual square root. 
(To make it simpler, the input will just contain square numbers.)

#### Examples

```js
console.log(sqrt(25))
// => 5

console.log(sqrt(7056))
// => 84
```
