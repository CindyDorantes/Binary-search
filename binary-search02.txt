a variable called SQR that has the square number
a variable called START	that has the start of the range
a variable called END that has the end of the range
a variable called DIVISION that will be the middle of the range and the
   the number the SQR will be divided by
a variable called RESULT that will have the result of the divission and 
   that will be compared with DIVISION
 
SQR = 16

Set the range
  set START = 1 = [1]
  set END = (SQR -1) = [15]

 3 4 5 
---> returb here

Set Division --> this is the middle point of the binary search
  DIVISION = [( START + END ) / 2 ] = [3 + 5]/2 = [4]

Set RESULT 
  RESULT = SQR / DIVISION = [16] / [4] = [4]

If the RESULT[4] is equal to DIVISION [4]
   return the division

else if DIVISION [3] is greater than result [5.3]
   then set END = DIVISION = [5]
   return to beginnig 

else if DIVISION [3] is less than the result [5.3]
  then set START = DIVISION = [3]
  return to beginning
